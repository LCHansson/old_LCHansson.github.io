Hi.

I'm Love Hansson, a Swedish developer, analyst, and activist of sorts currently residing in Stockholm, Sweden.

Most of my time goes towards contributing to projects that combine social/political improvement with hacking, analytical work and meeting new people. I'm a firm believer in using data driven analysis to make serious improvements to our understanding of policy, society and economic relations, and I try to work with open source and open data whenever possible.

These are some of the projects I've recently been involved with:

- [Kvartersregeringen.se][Kvartersregeringen]
- [Hack for Sweden][HfS], where I won the visualization award together with friends Jonathan Hise Kaldma and Jens Finn√§s
- Co-founder of the [Stockholm R User Group][SRUG]
- [sweSCB][sweSCB], an open source library for accessing the open data of [Statistics Sweden][SCB] through my favorite open source analytics language, [R][R].
- [iPlot][iPlot], an R-based tool (and webservice) for interactive data visualization

And while we're on the topic of development, here's [a sort of summary][Summary] of my open source contributions over the past year or so.

Currently, I'm working as a data analyst and administrative manager over at the [Swedish Pensions Agency][SwedishPensionsAgency]. I've been involved in some pretty neat stuff there, including the introduction of [our very own GitHub page][SwedishPensionsAgencyGitHub]; wondrous adventures in [data visualization][iPlot]; setting up [automated report generation systems][OrangeRapport]; the development of a [beginner's course in R][RForNyborjare] (in Swedish); and more.


On GitHub (and Twitter, and other nice places) I'm [LCHansson][LCHansson].
